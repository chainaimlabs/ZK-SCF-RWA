# zkApp: Recursion

You build recursive zkApps by using ZkProgram, the o1js general purpose API for creating zero knowledge proofs. 

A ZkProgram is similar to zkApp smart contracts but isn't tied to an on-chain account. This tutorial code is an example of a simple zkRollup. This tutorial guides you through a review of a simple zkRollup example that can be used to implement a zkRollup or an app chain.

## Tutorial
