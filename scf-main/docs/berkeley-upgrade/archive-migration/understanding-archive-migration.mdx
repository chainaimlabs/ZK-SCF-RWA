# Understanding the Archive Migration

You can reduce risks and effort by reading all of the archive documentation in entirety.

## Archive node migration overview

Archive node migration is a crucial part of the Berkeley upgrade. The current Devnet and Mainnet database format must be converted to the Berkeley format to preserve historical data and assure archive node chain continuity.

For this purpose, the o1Labs and Mina Foundation teams prepared a migration package.

### Archive node Berkeley migration package

This package contains the required applications to migrate existing Devnet and Mainnet databases into the new Berkeley schema and a usability script:

1. **berkeley-migration**

  Use the **berkeley-migration** app to migrate as much data as possible from the Devnet/Mainnet database and download precomputed blocks to get the window density data. 
  
  This app runs against the Devnet/Mainnet database and the new Berkeley database.

2. **replayer app in migration mode**

  The existing replayer application is enhanced with a new migration mode. Use the **replayer app in migration mode** to analyze the transactions in the partially migrated database (resulting from running berkeley-migration app) and populate the `accounts_accessed` and `accounts_created` tables. This app also does the checks performed by the standard replayer, but does not check ledger hashes because the Berkeley ledger has greater depth that results in different hashes. 
  
  This app runs only against the new archive database.

3. **berkeley-migration-verifier**

  Use the **berkeley-migration-verifier** verification software to determine if the migration (even incomplete) was successful. The app uses SQL validations on the migrated database.

4. **end-to-end migration script**

  This shell script wraps all phases and stages of migration into a single script. It is provided purely for node operators usability and is equivalent of running the **berkely-migration** app, the **replayer app in migration mode**, and the **berkeley-migration-verifier** apps in the correct order.

### Incrementality

Use the **berkeley-migration** and **replayer** apps incrementally so that you can migrate part of the Devnet/Mainnet database, and, as new blocks are added to the Devnet/Mainnet databases, the new data can be migrated.

To obtain that incrementality, the **berkeley-migration** app looks at the migrated database and determines the most recent migrated block. It continues migration starting at the next block in the Devnet/Mainnet data. The **replayer app in migration mode** uses the checkpoint mechanism already in place for the replayer. A checkpoint file indicates the global slot since genesis for starting the replay and the ledger to use for that replay. New checkpoint files are written as it proceeds.

To take advantage of the incrementality, run a cron job that migrates a day's worth of data at a time (or some other interval). With the cron job in place, at the time of the actual Berkeley upgrade, you will need to migrate only a small amount of data.
