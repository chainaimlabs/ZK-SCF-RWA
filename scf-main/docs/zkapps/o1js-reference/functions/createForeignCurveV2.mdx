```ts
function createForeignCurveV2(params: CurveParams): typeof ForeignCurveV2
```

Create a class representing an elliptic curve group, which is different from the native [Group](../classes/Group.mdx).

```ts
const Curve = createForeignCurve(Crypto.CurveParams.Secp256k1);
```

`createForeignCurve(params)` takes curve parameters CurveParams as input.
We support `modulus` and `order` to be prime numbers up to 259 bits.

The returned [ForeignCurveV2](../classes/ForeignCurveV2.mdx) class represents a _non-zero curve point_ and supports standard
elliptic curve operations like point addition and scalar multiplication.

[ForeignCurveV2](../classes/ForeignCurveV2.mdx) also includes to associated foreign fields: `ForeignCurve.Field` and `ForeignCurve.Scalar`, see createForeignFieldV2.

## Parameters

â€¢ **params**: `CurveParams`

## Returns

*typeof* [`ForeignCurveV2`](../classes/ForeignCurveV2.mdx)
