# o1js &nbsp; [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/o1js.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/o1js) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

ℹ️ **o1js** is an evolution of [SnarkyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkyjs) which saw
49 updated versions over two years of development with 43,141 downloads.

This name change to o1js reflects the evolution of our vision for the premiere toolkit used by developers to build zero knowledge-enabled applications, while paying homage to our technology's recursive proof generation capabilities.

Your favorite functionality stays the same and transitioning to o1js is a quick and easy process:

- To update zkApp-cli, run the following command:

  `npm i -g zkapp-cli@latest`

- To remove the now-deprecated SnarkyJS package and install o1js, run the following command:

  `npm remove snarkyjs && npm install o1js`

- For existing zkApps, make sure to update your imports from `snarkyjs` to `o1js`
- No need to redeploy, you are good to go!

## o1js

o1js helps developers build apps powered by zero knowledge (zk) cryptography.

The easiest way to write zk programs is using o1js.

o1js is a TypeScript library for [zk-SNARKs](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/what-are-zk-snarks) and zkApps. You can use o1js to write zk smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol.

o1js is automatically included when you create a project using the [zkApp CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkapp-cli).

## Learn More

- To learn more about developing zkApps, see the [zkApp Developers](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps) docs.

- For guided steps building and using zkApps, see the [zkApp Developers Tutorials](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/tutorials/hello-world).

Some machines may have a large number of cores, but not enough memory to support that many workers. In that case, you can set the number of workers to a lower number to avoid running out of memory. On the other hand, some machines with heterogeneous cores may benefit from setting the number of workers to a lower number to avoid contention between core types if load-link/store-conditional multithreading is used.
