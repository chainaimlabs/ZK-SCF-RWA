# Sending requests

After the Rosetta app is running, you can send requests to it.
To run a `/network/list` request:

    curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:3087/network/list' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Accept: application/json' -d '{}'

In the case of successful setups, you see a response similar to this one:


```json
{"network_identifiers":[{"blockchain":"mina","network":"mainnet"}]}
```

You must pass the `network_identifier` object as a parameter to all other endpoints. In Mina Rosetta implementation, it exists only for the network you run Rosetta for, so this array always contains one object.

Learn how to use Rosetta API for different use cases. See in the [Code Samples](samples) section.
