After everything is ready, you can implement deposit tracking.

For that, iterate through all transactions in each block to search for `payment_receiver_inc` operation with an address matching the address in which you are interested:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
async function trackDeposit(address: string) {
  // some logic we want to execute on deposit
  function onDeposit(deposit: any) {
    console.log(deposit)
  }
  let latestBlock = (await networkStatus()).current_block_identifier.index
  while (true) {
    // check if transactions to the deposit address are present in the latest block
    const txs = (await waitForBlock(latestBlock)).block.transactions
    const deposits = []
    for (let tx of txs) {
      for (let op of tx.operations) {
        if (op.account.address === address && op.type === "payment_receiver_inc") {
          deposits.push({
            tx_hash: tx.transaction_identifier.hash,
            amount: op.amount.value,
          })
        }
      }
    }

    // process deposits
    for (let d of deposits) {
      onDeposit(d)
    }

    latestBlock += 1
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

```python
def deposit_flow(deposit_address):
    # some logic we want to execute on deposit
    def on_deposit(deposit):
        print(json.dumps(deposit, indent=2))
    
    latest_block = network_status()["current_block_identifier"]["index"]
    while True:
        # check if transactions to the deposit address are present in the latest block
        txs = wait_for_block(latest_block)['block']['transactions']
        deposits = []
        for tx in txs:
            for op in tx["operations"]:
                if op["account"]["address"] == deposit_address \
                        and op["type"] == "payment_receiver_inc":
                    deposits.append({
                        "tx_hash": tx["transaction_identifier"]["hash"],
                        "amount": op["amount"]["value"]
                    })
        
        # process deposits
        for d in deposits:
            on_deposit(d)

        latest_block += 1
```
