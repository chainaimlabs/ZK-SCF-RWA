# About Seed Peers

Seed peer providers are an independent group of nodes that assist new nodes to find peers and connect to the Mina Protocol. Seed peers improve the onboarding experience for other nodes and make sure the nodes start bootstrapping as soon as possible.

Mina's seed peers are considered to be leaders among the community. They are not compensated in any way - they perform their role as a service to the Mina community.

For the full list of seed peers and information on how to contribute, please refer to the [Official Git Repository](https://github.com/MinaFoundation/seeds).
