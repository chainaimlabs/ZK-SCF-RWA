# Archive Nodes Getting Started

Mina nodes are succinct by default, so they don't need to maintain historical information about the network, block, or transactions.

For some use cases, it is useful to maintain this historical data on an archive node.

:::tip

A zkApp can retrieve events and actions from one or more Mina archive nodes. If your smart contract needs to fetch events and actions from an archive node, see [How to Fetch Events and Actions](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/feature-overview/fetch-events-and-actions).

:::

An archive node is a regular mina daemon that is connected to a running `mina-archive` process using the `--archive-address` flag.

The daemon regularly sends blockchain data to the archive process that stores it in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## Archive Node Requirements

**Software**: Supported environments include macOS, Linux (Debian 10, 11 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS), and any host machine with Docker.

**Processor**: Only x86-64 CPU architecture is supported.

**Hardware**: Running an archive node does not require any special hardware.

In addition to the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database requirements, running an archive node on the Mina network requires at least:

- 8-core processor
- 32 GB of RAM
- 64 GB of free storage

Running an archive node requires some knowledge of managing a PostgreSQL database instance. You must set up a database, run the archive node, connect it to a daemon, and run queries on the data.

## Install Mina, PostgreSQL, and the archive node package

1. Install the latest version of Mina.

  You must upgrade to the latest version of the daemon. Follow the steps in [Getting Started](../block-producer-node/getting-started).

1. Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

1. Install the archive node package.

   - Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install mina-archive=3.0.0-93e0279
     ```

   - Docker:

     ```
     minaprotocol/mina-archive:3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye
     ```

## Set up the archive node

These steps might be different for your operating system, if you're connecting to a cloud instance of PostgreSQL, if your deployment uses Docker, or if you want to run these processes on different machines.

For production, run the archive database in the background, use your operating system service manager (like systemd) to run it for you, or use a postgres service hosted by a cloud provider.

To run a local archive node to run it in the foreground for testing:

1. Start a local postgres server and connect to port 5432:

  ```sh
  postgres -p 5432 -D /usr/local/var/postgres
  ```

  For macOS:

  ```sh
  brew services start postgres
  ```

1. Create a local postgres database called `archive`:

  ```sh
  psql -p 5432 --h localhost -c "create database archive"
  ```

1. Load the mina archive schema into the archive database, (create_schema.sql and zkapp_tables.sql):

  ```sh
  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d archive -f <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinaProtocol/mina/release/3.0.0/src/app/archive/create_schema.sql)

  ```

1. Start the archive process on port 3086 and connect to the postgres database that runs on port 5432:

  ```sh
  mina-archive run \
    --postgres-uri postgres://localhost:5432/archive \
    --server-port 3086
  ```

4. Start the mina daemon and connect it to the archive process that you started on port 3086:

  ```
  mina daemon \
      .....
    --archive-address 3086

  ```

  To connect to an archive process on another machine, specify a hostname with <ipaddress:portnumber> i.e. `154.97.53.97:3086`.

## Set up the archive node using Docker

To get started with installing and running the archive node using Docker, follow the steps below.

1. Install Docker on your machine. For more information, see [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Pull the archive node image from Docker Hub.

   ```sh
   docker pull minaprotocol/mina-archive:3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye
   ```

3. Pull and install the postgres image from Docker Hub.

   ```sh
   docker pull postgres
   ```

4. Start the postgres container and expose it's networking to other containers.

   ```sh
   docker run --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
   ```

5. Create a local postgres database called `archive`.

   ```sh
   docker exec -it postgres createdb -U postgres archive
   ```

6. Load the mina archive schemas into the archive database, (create_schema.sql and zkapp_tables.sql.)

   ```sh
   curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinaProtocol/mina/1551e2faaa246c01636908aabe5f7981715a10f4/src/app/archive/create_schema.sql | docker exec -i postgres psql -U postgres -d archive

   curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinaProtocol/mina/1551e2faaa246c01636908aabe5f7981715a10f4/src/app/archive/zkapp_tables.sql | docker exec -i postgres psql -U postgres -d archive

   ```

7. Create a local directory to store the archive node data.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p /tmp/archive
   ```

8. Start the archive node.

   ```sh
   docker run \
   --name archive \
   -p 3086:3086 \
   -v /tmp/archive:/data \
   minaprotocol/mina-archive:3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye \
   mina-archive run \
   --postgres-uri postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/archive \
   --server-port 3086

   ```

:::warning

Please be careful when using `--config` argument at archive node bootstrap.

It should be provided only when archive node is connected to
short lived network created mainly for testing, local development or experimental networks.

*Never* use it on long lived network such as mainnet or devnet


:::

9. Start the mina daemon and connect it to the archive process that you started on port 3086:

   ```
   mina daemon \
       .....
     --archive-address 3086

   ```
  To connect to an archive process on another machine, specify a hostname with <ipaddress:portnumber> i.e. `154.97.53.97:3086`.


## Set up the archive node using Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

To run the archive node using Docker Compose:

1. Install Docker on your machine. For more information, see [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Install Docker Compose on your machine. For more information, see [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

3. Pull the archive node image from Docker Hub.

   ```sh
   docker pull minaprotocol/mina-archive:3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye
   ```

4. Pull and install the postgres image from Docker Hub.

   ```sh
    docker pull postgres
   ```

5. Create a local directory to store the archive node data.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p /tmp/archive
   ```

6. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

   ```yml
   services:
     postgres:
       image: postgres
       environment:
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
       volumes:
         - './postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data'
       ports:
         - '5432:5432'
     archive:
       image: 'minaprotocol/mina-archive:3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye'
       command: >-
         mina-archive run --postgres-uri
         postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/archive --server-port 3086
       volumes:
         - '/tmp/archive:/data'
       ports:
         - '3086:3086'
       depends_on:
         - postgres
   ```

7. Start the archive node.

   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```

8. Start the mina daemon and connect it to the archive process that you started on port 3086:

   ```
   mina daemon \
       .....
     --archive-address 3086

   ```

     To connect to an archive process on another machine, specify a hostname with <ipaddress:portnumber> i.e. `154.97.53.97:3086`.


## Using the Archive Node

Take a look at the tables in the database.

To list the tables, run the `\dt` command in psql. The output will look like this:

```
                  List of relations

(45 rows)

```

Use the `\d table_name` to look at the structure of a table in the database.

For example to see the structure of the user_commands table, run the `\d user_commands` command in psql. The output will look like this:

```
                                    Table "public.user_commands"
    Column    |       Type        | Collation | Nullable |                  Default
--------------+-------------------+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------------

Review the full schema at [/archive/create_schema.sql](https://github.com/minaProtocol/mina/blob/master/src/app/archive/create_schema.sql) and [/archive/zkapp_tables.sql](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/berkeley/src/app/archive/zkapp_tables.sql)

## Query the database

Now that you know the structure of the data, try some queries.

**Example 1:** Find all blocks that were created by your public key:

```
SELECT *
FROM blocks AS b
INNER JOIN public_keys AS pk1 ON b.creator_id = pk1.id
WHERE value = 'MY_PK'
```

**Example 2:** Find all payments received by your public key:

```
SELECT *
FROM user_commands AS uc
JOIN blocks_user_commands AS buc ON uc.id = buc.user_command_id
JOIN public_keys AS pk ON uc.receiver_id = pk.id
WHERE value = 'MY_PK'
AND type = 'payment'
```

**Example 3:** Find the block at height 12 on the canonical chain:

```
WITH RECURSIVE chain AS (
  (SELECT ... FROM blocks b WHERE height = (select MAX(height) from blocks)
  ORDER BY timestamp ASC
  LIMIT 1)

  UNION ALL

  SELECT ... FROM blocks b
  INNER JOIN chain
  ON b.id = chain.parent_id AND chain.id <> chain.parent_id
) SELECT ..., pk.value as creator FROM chain c
  INNER JOIN public_keys pk
  ON pk.id = c.creator_id
  WHERE c.height = 12
```

**Example 3:** List the counts of blocks created by each public key and sort them in descending order"

```
SELECT p.value, COUNT(*) FROM blocks
INNER JOIN public_keys AS p ON creator_id = ip.id
GROUP BY p.value
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Example 4:** List the counts of applied payments created by each public key and sort them in descending order:

```
SELECT p.value, COUNT(*) FROM user_commands
INNER JOIN public_keys AS p ON source_id = p.id
WHERE status = 'applied'
AND type = 'payment'
GROUP BY p.value ORDER BY count DESC;
```
**Example 5** Get the latest block:

```
SELECT
height as blockheight,
global_slot_since_genesis as globalslotsincegenesis,
global_slot_since_hard_fork as globalslot,
state_hash as statehash,
parent_hash as parenthash,
ledger_hash as ledgerhash,
to_char(to_timestamp(cast ("timestamp" as bigint) / 1000) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC', 'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SS') || '.' ||
    LPAD(((cast("timestamp" as bigint) % 1000)::text), 3, '0') || 'Z' as datetime
FROM blocks
WHERE id in (SELECT MAX(id) FROM blocks);

```

**Example 6** Identify blocks with missing parents, between blockheight 500 and blockheight 5000
```
SELECT height
FROM blocks
WHERE parent_id is null AND height >= 500 AND height <= 5000 and height > 1;

```
