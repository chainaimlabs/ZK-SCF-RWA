# Generating a Key Pair

## About Key Pairs

Two different key pairs are relevant to node operators:

- Wallet keypairs you generate with the steps provided here
- libp2p keypairs that are gossip network identities

To use Mina on Mainnet or to fully participate in a Mina test network, the first step is to generate a wallet key pair that consists of a public key and a private key. The public key identifies each block producer on the network.

In some cases, you want to generate more than one wallet key pair. For example, to run a block producer most securely, it is advisable to have accounts on both hot and cold wallets. See [Hot and Cold Block Production](/node-operators/block-producer-node/hot-cold-block-production).

The supported tools for generating public/private key pairs are:

- [mina-generate-keypair](#mina-generate-keypair) command line utility
- [mina libp2p generate-keypair](#generating-and-using-your-libp2p-keys) mina subcommand
- [Mina Signer](/node-operators/mina-signer)
- [Mina command line wallet package](https://github.com/jspada/ledger-app-mina/blob/v1.0.0-beta.2/README.md#command-line-wallet) that interfaces with your Ledger device and Mina blockchain to generate addresses on the Ledger hardware wallet

Always give out your public keys. Mina will never ask you for your private keys. Be sure that your private keys are stored safely.


:::caution

Never give out your private key.

:::

If you lose your private key or if a malicious actor gains access to your private key, you will lose access to your account and lose your account funds.

## Mina Generate Keypair

The `mina-generate-keypair` command line utility is the simplest method to create a public/private key pair.

```
Generate a new public, private keypair

  mina-generate-keypair

=== flags ===

  --privkey-path FILE  File to write private key into (public key will be
                       FILE.pub)
                       (alias: -privkey-path)
  [-build-info]        print info about this build and exit
  [-version]           print the version of this build and exit
  [-help]              print this help text and exit
                       (alias: -?)
```

### Installation on Ubuntu and Debian

1. Set up the Debian stable repository and install the latest binary version for [Ubuntu and Debian](/node-operators/block-producer-node/getting-started#ubuntu-and-debian).

1. Install the mina-generate-keypair utility:

    ```sh
    echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y mina-mainnet=3.0.0-93e0279
    ```

1. Verify that the key generation tool installed correctly:

    ```sh
    mina -version
    ```

    The expected output is:

    ```
    Commit 93e02797f72abe2cbf8dfca6f2328e9c8cd76546 on branch berkeley
    ```

### macOS, Windows, and platforms other than Ubuntu and Debian

Install Docker. Follow the Docker-based instructions to generate key pairs.

## Using mina advanced generate-keypair

1. Create a folder on your system where you can store the key files. By convention, the `~/keys` folder:

    ```sh
    mkdir ~/keys
    ```

1. Ensure the permissions are set properly for this folder to prevent unwanted processes from accessing these files:

    ```sh
    chmod 700 ~/keys
    ```

## Generate your keys for Ubuntu and Debian.

:::caution
Make sure to set a new and secure password for the following commands. Mina will never ask you for this password. Do not share this password with anyone.
:::

1. Run the `mina advanced generate-keypair` command:

    ```
    mina advanced generate-keypair --privkey-path ~/keys/my-wallet
    ```

1. When prompted, type in the password you intend to use to secure this key. <em>Do NOT forget this password.</em> If already set, the tool uses the password from the `MINA_PRIVKEY_PASS` environment variable instead of prompting you.

## Generate keys on Docker for Windows, macOS, and Linux

1. Use the `minaprotocol/generate-keypair` Docker image:

    ```
    cd ~
    docker run -it --rm --entrypoint "" \
           --volume $(pwd)/keys:/keys \
           minaprotocol/mina-daemon:3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye-mainnet \
           mina advanced generate-keypair --privkey-path /keys/my-wallet
    ```

1. When prompted, type in the password you intend to use to secure this key. <em>Do NOT forget this password.</em>

    Two files are created for your public/private key pair:

    - `~/keys/my-wallet`: the encrypted private key
    - `~/keys/my-wallet.pub`: the public key in plain text

1. Finally, ensure the permissions are set properly for the private key file to prevent unwanted processes from accessing it.

    ```
    chmod 600 $(pwd)/keys/my-wallet
    ```

Be sure to store the private key file and password you used in a secure place, such as a password manager.

## Validate your private key

Now that you've created your key, validate that it works. It's sufficient to use the `mina advanced validate-keypair` command to verify that you can sign a transaction.

On Linux:

```
mina advanced validate-keypair --privkey-path <path-to-the-private-key-file>
```

On Docker:

```
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint "" \
        --volume $(pwd)/keys:/keys \
        minaprotocol/mina-daemon:3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye-mainnet \
        mina advanced validate-keypair --privkey-path /keys/my-wallet
```

## Generating and using your libp2p keys

To ensure connectivity across the network, it is essential that all seed nodes start with the **same** `libp2p` keypair.
This consistency allows other nodes in the network to reliably connect.
Use the `libp2p` subcommand of `mina` CLI utility to create a libp2p key pair.

```
mina libp2p generate-keypair --privkey-path <path-to-the-key-file>
```

Generated libp2p keys can then be used with the Mina Daemon startup command like this:

```
mina daemon ... --libp2p-keypair <path-to-the-key-file> ...
```

## Ledger Hardware Wallet

You can use your [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet to securely store your Mina private keys. To get started, install the Mina app on the [Ledger Hardware Wallet](/using-mina/ledger-hardware-wallet).

### Mina Signer

You can also use [Mina Signer](/node-operators/mina-signer) to generate key pairs and sign transactions.

## Installation Instructions

See [Getting Started](./block-producer-node/getting-started)

## Next steps

Now that you have created a public/private key pair, you are ready to [connect to the network](./block-producer-node/connecting-to-the-network) or share your public key.
