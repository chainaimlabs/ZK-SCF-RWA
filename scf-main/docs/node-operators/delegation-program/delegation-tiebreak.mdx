# Delegation Program Tiebreak System

At the end of every delegation cycle, the [Delegation Program Uptime Tracker](https://uptime.minaprotocol.com/) determines up to 240 external validators who have received the highest Performance Scores. In cases where a tiebreak is needed, a random tiebreak process is implemented to ensure fairness and transparency. You can follow these verification instructions to verify the results.

## How the Delegation Program Tiebreak System Works

1. Block producer keys that straddle the 240th place in the uptime snapshot are determined eligible to receive a [Mina Foundation Delegation](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/mina-foundation-delegation-policy).

1. This list of tied keys is sorted alphanumerically using the [canonical ASCII representation](http://support.ecisolutions.com/doc-ddms/help/reportsmenu/ascii_sort_order_chart.htm).

1. The sorted list is randomized using the Random.org advanced [List Randomizer](https://www.random.org/lists/?mode=advanced).

  The [VRF](/glossary#verifiable-random-function-vrf) seed from the last epoch of the previous cycle is used as the “persistent identifier”.

## Verifying the Delegation Program Random Tiebreak

### Requirements

To verify the Delegation Program random tiebreak result, you must have:

- The [Verifiable Random Function [VRF](/glossary#verifiable-random-function-vrf) seed from the last epoch of the previous cycle.
- The list of tied wallet addresses.
- A sorting tool. For example, [https://onlinestringtools.com/sort-strings](https://onlinestringtools.com/sort-strings).
- A randomizing tool. For example, [https://www.random.org/lists/?mode=advanced](https://www.random.org/lists/?mode=advanced).

### Instructions

1. Identify the VRF seed from the last epoch of the previous cycle.

    - The VRF seed is posted with the list of the Top 240 eligible delegatees.
    - To obtain the VRF seed by yourself, you can query the [https://api.minascan.io/node/v1/graphql](https://api.minascan.io/node/v1/graphql) using the last epoch of the previous cycle with:

      ```
      query epochSeed {
        blocks(limit: 1, query: {canonical: true, protocolState: {consensusState: {epoch: 33}}}) {
          protocolState {
            consensusState {
              stakingEpochData {
                seed
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      The results of this sample query for `Epoch 33` return the seed:

      ```

      ```

1. Sort the tied wallet addresses alphanumerically using the canonical ASCII representation.

    To use a tool like [Sort Strings](https://onlinestringtools.com/sort-strings):

    - Clear the **Sort strings numerically** checkbox.
    - Enter the tied addresses in **input strings** with <u>no extra spaces or line breaks</u>.
    - Copy the sorted wallet addresses from **sorted strings**.

3. Randomize the sorted list of tied wallet addresses using Random.org and the VRF seed from Step 1.

    - In **Part 1: Enter List Items** on [https://www.random.org/lists/?mode=advanced](https://www.random.org/lists/?mode=advanced), enter the sorted list of addresses.
    - In **Part 2: Choose Output Format**, select **As a bare-bones text document (type text/plain)**.
    - In **Part 3: Choose Randomization**, select **Use pregenerated randomization based on persistent identifier enter-id-here (max 64 alphanumeric characters)** and enter the VRF seed you identified in the **“enter-id-here”** field.
    - In **Part 4: Go!**, select **Randomize**.

You can follow this process to confirm the random tiebreak result.
