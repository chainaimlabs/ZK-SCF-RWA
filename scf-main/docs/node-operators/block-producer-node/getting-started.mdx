# Block Producer Getting Started

Welcome to Mina!

Get started setting up a Mina node, learn how to [generate a key pair](/node-operators/generating-a-keypair) for use with the network, and install the `mina daemon`.

This documentation is for the **Mainnet** release. You can find the releases and version-specific flags on the [Mina Protocol releases](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases) page.

## Block Producer Requirements

**Software**: Supported environments include macOS, Linux (Debian 10, 11 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS), and any host machine with Docker.

**Processor**: Only x86-64 CPU architecture is supported.

**Hardware**: Sending and receiving MINA does not require any special hardware.

Running a block producer on the Mina network requires at least:

- 8-core processor
- 32 GB of RAM
- 64 GB of free storage

**Network**: At least 1 Mbps connection

**VM Instances**:

o1Labs has tested running nodes on several cloud providers. We recommend the following instances for basic node operator needs. Custom requirements and different cost constraints might require a different instance type.

- AWS [c5.2xlarge](https://www.ec2instances.info/?filter=c5.2xl&region=us-west-2&cost_duration=daily&selected=c5.2xlarge)
- GCP [c2-standard-8](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types)
- Azure [Standard_F8s_v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-compute#fsv2-series-1)
- Digital Ocean [c-8-16gib](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?size=c-8-16gib)

## Installation

To install the latest [Mainnet **Stable** Release 3.0.0](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases/tag/3.0.0), use the installation steps for your environment. Supported environments include macOS, Linux (Debian 10, 11 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS), and any host machine with Docker.

The binary download is around 1 GB, so the installation might take a few minutes.

To discover and install pre-release (Beta) builds, see the [Mina Releases](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases) page on GitHub.

### Ubuntu and Debian

Set up the new Debian `stable` repository and install the latest binary version.

Set up and update the rampup Debian Repository for your platform.

```
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina*.list
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.o1test.net $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mina.list
sudo apt-get update
```

Now install the node package.

```
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip mina-mainnet=3.0.0-93e0279
```


To verify the mina daemon installation, run:

- `mina version`

The expected output is `Commit 93e02797f72abe2cbf8dfca6f2328e9c8cd76546 on branch berkeley`.

### If you are using Ufw, allow these permissions

``` text
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow 8302
sudo ufw allow 3089
```

### Windows
Windows is not natively supported. Instead, use the [Docker instructions](getting-started#docker).

If you are interested in receiving a grant to develop Mina for Windows, email grants@o1labs.org or reach out in the [Mina Protocol Discord server](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol).

### macOS

macOS is used by developers and is not officially supporting any pre-built packages.

Instead, use the Docker instructions or build from source.

### Docker

Docker is a cross-platform tool. You can download and install Docker on multiple platforms.

Use the Docker installation instructions for your platform on [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After Docker is installed, follow the [Connect to the Mina Network](/node-operators/block-producer-node/connecting-to-the-network#docker) instructions.

### Build from source

On Linux or macOS operating systems, you can experiment with [Building Mina](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/master/README-dev.md#building-mina) from source code.

Other operating systems haven't been tested thoroughly and might have issues. You can share logs and get troubleshooting help in the [Mina Protocol Discord server](https://discord.gg/minaprotocol).

## Set up port forwarding and firewalls

If you are running a firewall, you must allow traffic on TCP port 8302.

Unless the `-external-ip YOUR_IP` flag is provided, the daemon uses HTTPS (443) and HTTP (80) to determine its own IP address.

Enable port forwarding on your router to allow inbound traffic to the following ports through your **external** IP address:

- TCP port `8302`
- To use the GraphQL service, expose TCP port `3085`
