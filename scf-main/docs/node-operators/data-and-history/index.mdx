# About Data and History

Mina is a succinct blockchain, and as a result, consensus nodes store only the recent history of the chain before discarding it (the last k blocks, currently 290). You can access recent history by using graphQL from a running mina daemon.

While prior transaction history is not required to prove the current state is valid (this is handled by using a recursive zero-knowledge proof), many applications need to access prior transaction history. Examples include block explorers and wallets.

You can optionally run an [archive node](/node-operators/archive-node/getting-started) to access historic data. The archive node process stores a summary of each block in a Postgres database. The archive node requires a running mina-archive daemon that connects to a running mina daemon and a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## Data and History

This section describes how to query data in the Mina protocol.

- [Querying Data](data-and-history/querying-data) - Examples for querying data.
- [Rosetta](data-and-history/rosetta) - An open-source specification and set of tools used for deploying and interacting with the Mina Protocol.
