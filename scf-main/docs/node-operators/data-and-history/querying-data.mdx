# Querying Data

<Subhead>
Data querying for node operators.
</Subhead>

Some node operators don't wish to participate in block production or SNARK work creation, but just want to sit on the network and passively aggregate information for querying or submit signed transactions. These nodes don't require an account key pair themselves to run successfully.

## Preparation

In addition to [installing the Mina daemon on your machine](/node-operators/block-producer-node/getting-started), you may also want to have some system set up to archive historical information on your machine. To do so you can setup an [archive node](/node-operators/archive-node/getting-started), archive by using [other redundant means](/node-operators/archive-node/archive-redundancy), or both.

## Running a node

The best way to learn how to run a node is to follow the [Connect to the Mina Network](../block-producer-node/connecting-to-the-network) instructions.

To prevent this node from starting as a block producer, remove the `MINA_PRIVKEY_PASS` and `-block-producer-key ...` flags.

To expose recent information of the blockchain, expose the GraphQL REST server.

You can provide `-rest-server-port XXXX` if the default port of 0xc0d or 3085 does not work for you. 

To make the REST server accessible from outside of `localhost`, provide `-insecure-rest-server`. Make sure you set your firewall up properly. See [GraphQL API](/node-developers/graphql-api) for more information.

## Querying information

Presented here are examples about querying for _recent_ information on the chain -- around 290 blocks, in practice around 10 hours of recent activity. 

The best way to explore all the specific details available for each of the GraphQL objects is to visit your favorite web browser pointing to the REST server running from within a Mina daemon that hosts a GraphQL sandbox. Visit the [GraphQL API page](/node-developers/graphql-api) to learn more. Documentation is also present on most of the individual fields, you can learn more about each field by hovering over the entries in the sandbox or by visiting the hosted schema (coming soon).

### Block data

```javascript
query BlockData {
  bestChain(maxLength: 10) {
    stateHash
    creatorAccount {
      balance {
        total
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Current Balance

The following is a query for accessing the current balance of a public key. Note that you can also ask for the blockHeight and stateHash of the block that this balance is inspected within.

```javascript
query CurrentBalance {
  account(publicKey: "B62qmyjqEtUEZrsBpUaiz18DCkwh1ovCrJboiHbDhpvH8JEoaag5fUP") {
    balance {
      blockHeight
      total
      stateHash
    }
  }
}
```

### Staking Information

In Mina, accounts are either staked or delegated completely. There is no alternative state. The following is a way to query this information that is present in the current ledger.

```javascript
query StakingInfo {
  account(publicKey: "B62qmyjqEtUEZrsBpUaiz18DCkwh1ovCrJboiHbDhpvH8JEoaag5fUP") {
    balance {
      blockHeight
      total
      stateHash
    }
    delegateAccount {
      publicKey
    }
  }
}
```

If the delegateAccount.publicKey is null, then this account is "staking directly" and this private key should be used for block production directly.

Note that the actual staking and delegating in the current "epoch" is drawn from the "staking ledger". We are currently implementing a mechanism for accessing this staking ledger directly, but for now you'll need to periodically query for this information and store it internally and then refer to it when it becomes active. On epoch transitions, a new staking ledger is selected by promoting the SNARKed ledger of the last block two epochs prior. In practice, this is between 2-4 weeks.

### Get Transaction Details

Via GraphQL, you can lookup transactions within blocks on the bestChain as follows:

```javascript
query TransactionDetails {
  bestChain(maxLength: 10) {
    stateHash
    creatorAccount {
      balance {
        total
      }
    }
    transactions {
      coinbase
      userCommands {
        amount
        fee
        feePayer {
          publicKey
        }
        hash
        isDelegation
        kind
        memo
        nonce
        receiver {
          publicKey
        }
        source {
          publicKey
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Submit a Signed Transaction

You can send a signed transaction using the following GraphQL mutation. You can get information about the payment returned back to you as a sanity check.

```javascript
mutation SubmitSignedTransaction {
  __typename
  sendPayment(input: {
    fee: "3000000",
    amount: "42",
    to: "B62qrcFstkpqXww1EkSGrqMCwCNho86kuqBd4FrAAUsPxNKdiPzAUsy",
    from: "B62qiy32p8kAKnny8ZFwoMhYpBppM1DWVCqAPBYNcXnsAHhnfAAuXgg",
    nonce: "0",
    memo: "This is a memo",
    validUntil: "50000"
  }, signature: {
      field: "26393275544831950408026742662950427846842308902199169146789849923161392179806",
      scalar: "28530962508461835801829592060779431956054746814505059654319465133050504973404"
   }) {
    payment {
      amount
      fee
      kind
      memo
      nonce
      source {
        publicKey
      }
      receiver {
        publicKey
      }
      isDelegation
    }
  }
}
```
