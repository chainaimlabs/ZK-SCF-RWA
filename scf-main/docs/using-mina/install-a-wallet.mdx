# Install a Wallet

Learn about wallets you can use to send and receive MINA.

The Mina community has created a variety of different wallets. You can send
and receive MINA using any of these wallets, currently the Auro Wallet
for Chrome and MinaPortal support interactions with zkApps.

- [Auro Wallet (Chrome, Firefox, iOS, & Android)](https://www.aurowallet.com)
- [Clorio Wallet (Windows, MacOS, Linux, and online)](https://clor.io)
- [Ledger Mina Protocol wallet](https://www.ledger.com/mina-wallet) For instructions, see the [Ledger Hardware Wallet](../using-mina/ledger-hardware-wallet) doc.
- [MinaPortal, a MetaMask Snap](https://minaportal.sotatek.works/) To learn more, see the [MinaPortal wiki](https://github.com/sotatek-dev/mina-snap/wiki) .
- [Pallad (Chrome & Brave side panel)](https://get.pallad.co/website)

:::note

To prevent spam, the Mina network charges a one-time account creation fee of 1 MINA. This fee is automatically deducted from the first transaction received.

### Wallet for Node Operators

The Mina CLI also provides the ability to store, send, and receive MINA. However, this method is intended only for Mina node operators and we do **not** recommend this as a wallet for typical users. View the [Mina CLI docs](/node-operators/mina-cli-reference) to learn more.
