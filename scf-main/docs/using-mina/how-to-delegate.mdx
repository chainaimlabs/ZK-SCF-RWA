# How to Delegate

<Subhead>
Learn how to delegate MINA and receive staking rewards
</Subhead>

Instead of running your own node, you can delegate MINA to a validator (block producer) and receive staking rewards.

### Prerequisites

First, ensure you installed a Mina wallet with funds.

### Delegating MINA

Here’s how to delegate MINA within common wallets:

- [**Auro**](https://www.aurowallet.com) - Open the wallet, tap “*Staking*”, tap “*Go to Staking*”, select a block producer, and confirm the transaction details.

- [**Ledger Hardware Wallet**](https://www.ledger.com/mina-wallet) - Follow the [instructions on creating a Ledger Mina account via Auro Wallet](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/5458493215901-Creating-a-Ledger-MINA-account-via-Auro-Wallet?docs=true), then see the instructions for staking MINA on Auro wallet above.
- [**Pallad**](https://get.pallad.co/website) - Open the wallet, tap upper-right Menu button. Select "*Staking*" from the sidebar menu. Click "*Stake*", paste validator public key or use "*Find a validator*". Tap "*Next*", enter your spending password and submit to confirm the transaction.

:::note

When sending transactions on a blockchain, such as Mina, senders must include a transaction fee. Most wallets calculate a recommended fee. You can also view a suggested fee amount based on current network transaction volume at this community-created [Gas Station website](https://fees.mina.tools/).
