# ZK-SCF-RWA
ZK Proofs for Supply chain Finance RWA

## KEY PROBLEM

Supply chain Trade Finance is still under served and is a 2-3 Trillion gap. 

KEY issue is validation risk and the privacy aspects that are needed in business information share for 

Identity
Company Level compliance 
Export level compliance
Global LEI compliance

then pipes on to 

Financial Health 
Operational Execellence 

and then pipes on to deep supply financing. 

and a key aspect is RECURSIVE and small proofs based on off-chain computes and privacy- protected share.

The Insituitional Defi needs precise , succint and composed information for risk validation and reduciton for financing supply chain finance. and is a huge ask from Institutional financiers,  defi and risk management frameworks.


# KEY SOLUTION 

IMPLEMENTATION

Composed proofs

![Slide5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5e6fd04-3d79-4a74-8dd8-57d69202549f)

Proof1 for for Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 
Proof2 for Directorate of Foreign Trade. 

Proof 3 is a composed recursive proof for the truth table implemenation. 

ALL Proofs at a certain level and below are fully provenanced and provable. 

NEXT STEPS 

Further chaining for   Global Legal Entity Framework ( GLEIF )  for RWA 

and then for financial health, operational excellence and deep supply chain finance ( based on partipation in high performance supply chains)
